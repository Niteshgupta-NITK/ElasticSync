# ElasticSync
ElasticSync is a real-time Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline that streams Postgres database changes into Elasticsearch using Node.js, Kafka, and Debezium. Designed with an event-driven architecture, it ensures low-latency search, analytics, and fault-tolerant syncing between relational and NoSQL systems.
